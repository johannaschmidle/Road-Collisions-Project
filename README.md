## Motivation
**Goal:**  Gain insights into the patterns and trends of road accidents in the UK from 2019 to 2022 to inform policy-making and improve road safety.   

## Task List
1. Clean Database
2. Create Dashboard

## Metrics and Dimensions
- **Total** number of accidents
- **Accident Severity:** Accidents and percentage of total with respect to accident severity
- **Vehicle:** Total accidents by type of vehicle
- **Accidents per Year:** Monthly trend showing comparison of accidents for current year and previous year
- **Road Type:** accidents by road type
- **Light Condition:** accidents by day/night
- **Road Condition:** Distribution of total casualties by road condition
- **Location/Area:** The type of area where the collision takes place
- Relationship between accidents by area/location and by day/night
  
## Summary of Insights
#### Total Accidents
- There are 660,679 accidents in this database
  
#### Accident Severity
- Most accidents are only slight _accidents_ (making up 85.3% of accidents)
- Fatal accidents only account for 1.3% of total accidents
- Serious accidents only account for 13.4% of total accidents

#### Vehicle
- Regular cars are most often involved in an accident, followed by motorcycles

#### Accidents per year 
- Accidents seem to be high during May to July for all four years
- Most years hit a peak in accidents during November
- Most years hit a minimum number of accidents during February

#### Road Type
- Most collisions occur on a single-carriageway road (492.1K)
- The least amount of collisions occur on a slip road

#### Light Condition
- Most collisions occur during the daytime (around 75%)

#### Road Condition
- Most collisions occur on dry road conditions (447.8K)
- The least amount of collisions occur on flooded roads (1.0K) -- but this could be a result of the fact that floods are quite rare

#### Location/Area
- Most collisions happen in a rural area
